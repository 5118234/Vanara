## Assembly report for Vanara.PInvoke.Shared.dll
### Classes
Class | Description
---- | ----
AssociateAttribute | Associates a Guid with an element.
CoTaskMemStringMarshaler | Marshals strings that are allocated by native code and must be freed using CoTaskMemFree after use.
IEnumFromIndexer<T> | Creates an enumerable class from a counter and an indexer. Useful if a class doesn't support `IEnumerable` or <see cref="T:System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable`1" /> like some COM objects.
IEnumFromNext<T> | Creates an enumerable class from a get next method and a reset method. Useful if a class doesn't support `IEnumerable` or <see cref="T:System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable`1" /> like some COM objects.
Lib | Holds string values for all used external API libraries.
Macros | Platform invokable enumerated types, constants and functions from windows.h
OBJECT_TYPE_LIST | Identifies an object type element in a hierarchy of object types. An array of OBJECT_TYPE_LIST structures to define a hierarchy of an object and its subobjects, such as property sets and properties.
OverlappedAsync | Helper methods to work with asynchronous methods using `NativeOverlapped`.
OverlappedAsyncResult | Holds all pertinent information for handling results and errors in an overlapped set of method calls.
PInvokeDataAttribute | Captures information about P/Invoke calls.
PRECT | Defines the coordinates of the upper-left and lower-right corners of a rectangle.
SafeElementArray<T> | A safe unmanaged array of structures allocated on the global heap with a prefix type (usually a uint or int) that determines the count of elements.
SafeResourceId | Represents a system resource name that can identify as a string, integer, or pointer.
SECURITY_ATTRIBUTES | The SECURITY_ATTRIBUTES structure contains the security descriptor for an object and specifies whether the handle retrieved by specifying this structure is inheritable. This structure provides security settings for objects created by various functions, such as CreateFile, CreatePipe, CreateProcess, RegCreateKeyEx, or RegSaveKeyEx.
TryGetNext | Delegate that gets the next value in an enumeration and returns true or returns false to indicate there are no more items in the enumeration.
WIN32_FIND_DATA | Contains information about the file that is found by the FindFirstFile, FindFirstFileEx, or FindNextFile function.
### Structures
Struct | Description
---- | ----
HRESULT | Formal replacement for the Windows HRESULT definition. In windows.h, it is a defined UINT value. For .NET, this class strongly types the value.
MSG | Contains message information from a thread's message queue.
NTStatus | Formal replacement for the Windows NTStatus definition. In ntstatus.h, it is a defined UINT value. For .NET, this class strongly types the value.
OBJECT_TYPE_LIST | Identifies an object type element in a hierarchy of object types. An array of OBJECT_TYPE_LIST structures to define a hierarchy of an object and its subobjects, such as property sets and properties.
PRECT | Defines the coordinates of the upper-left and lower-right corners of a rectangle.
RECT | Defines the coordinates of the upper-left and lower-right corners of a rectangle.
SECURITY_ATTRIBUTES | The SECURITY_ATTRIBUTES structure contains the security descriptor for an object and specifies whether the handle retrieved by specifying this structure is inheritable. This structure provides security settings for objects created by various functions, such as CreateFile, CreatePipe, CreateProcess, RegCreateKeyEx, or RegSaveKeyEx.
SIZE | The SIZE structure specifies the width and height of a rectangle.
SizeT | Managed instance of the SIZE_T type.
SYSTEMTIME | Specifies a date and time, using individual members for the month, day, year, weekday, hour, minute, second, and millisecond. The time is either in coordinated universal time (UTC) or local time, depending on the function that is being called.
WIN32_FIND_DATA | Contains information about the file that is found by the FindFirstFile, FindFirstFileEx, or FindNextFile function.
